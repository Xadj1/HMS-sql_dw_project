- **Data Ingestion**: Raw patient data is loaded from a master ERP table.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardize and clean data (e.g., phone numbers, handle duplicates, and null values).  
- **Database Design**: Create normalized tables for patients, doctors, nurses, billing, insurance, and rooms.  
- **Analytics**: Use SQL queries, views, and stored procedures to generate insights.

### 📖 **Project Overview**  
This project involves:  

1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize and clean raw patient data for consistency.  
2. **Database Design**: Build a relational database with normalized tables.  
3. **SQL Programming**: Write SQL scripts to create tables, views, and stored procedures.  
4. **Advanced SQL**: Implement triggers, window functions, and recursive CTEs for advanced analytics.  
5. **Data Integrity**: Enforce primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for accurate data management.  
6. **Reporting**: Create SQL-based reports for patient summaries, billing status, and room availability.

### 🚀 **Project Requirements**  

#### **Building the Database (Data Engineering)**  
**Objective**:  
Develop a **relational database** using SQL Server to manage patient information, billing, and room allocations, enabling efficient healthcare operations.  

**Specifications**:  
- **Data Sources**: Load raw patient data from a master ERP table.  
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and standardize data (e.g., phone numbers, handle duplicates, and null values).  
- **Database Design**: Create normalized tables for patients, doctors, nurses, billing, insurance, and rooms.  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the database schema and workflows.  

#### **Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)**  
**Objective**:  
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver insights into:  
- **Patient Demographics**  
- **Billing and Payment Status**  
- **Room Occupancy and Availability**  
- **Doctor-Patient Assignments**  

These insights empower healthcare stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve operational efficiency.
